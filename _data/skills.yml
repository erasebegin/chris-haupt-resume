  description: I see teaching as a deep pursuit that takes many years of dedication to truly master. I have already taken great strides on my way to mastery, especially for educating young learners. I have been told by colleagues that I am capable and dedicated to my work, but I only know I am doing a truly great job when I see the way that my students respond to the lessons I have prepared.
