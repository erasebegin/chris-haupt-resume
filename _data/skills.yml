# Computers and IT
- skill: Computers and IT
  description: I have a broad range of technical skills that allow me to use computers with an advanced proficiency. All of my work is backed up regularly and I am able to use creative tools such as Powerpoint, video editors and audio editing software to create professional-standard products. I often erase my entire operating system and install a different one because I think it's fun. Hence my online handle 'erasebegin'.

# Writing
- skill: Writing
  description: I can always be seen jotting down sudden bolts of insight as my mind wanders to the realms of philosophy and beyond. I take language seriously and writing is my favourite way to express myself. I studied English at university because my friends and relatives always told me that my literacy skills were strong.

# Teaching
- skill: Teaching
  description: Few people have the good fortune to know what they enjoy most. For me it is teaching. I see teaching as a deep pursuit that takes many years of dedication to truly master. I plan to commit myself to that journey and in these early years I have already taken great strides on my way to mastery. I have been told by colleagues that I show great promise in the world of teaching.
