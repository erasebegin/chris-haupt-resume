          <p>I am extremely friendly, professional, positive and hard-working. I very much enjoy working as part of a team and have made friends in all of my previous roles. I am dedicated to both learning and teaching and enjoy both to such an extent that the lines between work and play seem blurred. I have gained a CELTA qualification to learn to teach English to the best of my ability and have two years of teaching experience. In my short time as a teacher I have learned a lot by always being curious and always paying attention. I am confident in my ability to deliver lessons that are as entertaining as they are informative. </p>

Of the ten English teachers, two were chosen to represent the school by giving an open class.
